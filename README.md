* Arduino based security system which uses motion sensors and Nokia phone to send SMS or make a call
* the code was only tested with Nokia 5140i
* in future hopefully I will look into the protocol more carefully and update my program to support more phones


SETUP
=====

For connecting my phone to Arduino I used [this cable](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/data-cable-compatible-with-nokia-ca-42-446?item=13). The cable can also be used to connected the phone to a linux PC and then controlled by [gnokii](http://gnokii.org/) or [gammu](http://wammu.eu/gammu/). For more information about the protocol see [this page](http://www.embedtronics.com/nokia/fbus.html)
