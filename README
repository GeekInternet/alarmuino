DESCRIPTION
===========

* Arduino based security system which uses motion sensors and Nokia phone to send SMS or make a call
* the system was only tested and fully working with Nokia 5140i
* in future hopefully I will look into the protocol more carefully and update my program to support more phones


SETUP
=====

for connecting my phone to Arduino I used this cable:
http://www.dealextreme.com/p/data-cable-compatible-with-nokia-ca-42-446?item=13
with this cable the phone can also be connected to the PC to use http://gnokii.org/ or http://wammu.eu/gammu/
for more information about the protocol see this page http://www.embedtronics.com/nokia/fbus.html
